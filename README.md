# ChatBot

# Introduction
A normal chatbot made using Deep Learning (python). A guided project for future reference for making a Therapist Chatbot. Will be labeled ref.

# Goal's
Making a chatbot trained on Web Scarped data of Some Therapist Conversation.

# NOTE
Was using the therapist from character.ai , which is made using OpenAI API, but the site became too popular and is now hard to use, also the chatbox itself seemed too grounded and unreal , dont know how to fix that but will try.
